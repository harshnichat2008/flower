Sun:
Located at the centre of the solar system is the sun. It is a star, like the ones you see in the night sky. A burning ball of gas, made mostly of hydrogen and helium, it provides us with the heat we need to survive. The sun is so massive that its gravity - the force that pulls things together - keeps the planet in the orbit around it.

Moon:
The moon is our closest neighbour and the only place in the solar system, other than Earth, that humans have set foot on. The moon is desert-like, with plains, mountains and valleys, and a black sky. It is covered with craters, because there is no atmosphere to protect it from space rocks.

Planet:
 A celestial body that does not produce its own light, is larger than an asteroid, and is illuminated by light from a star, such as the sun, around which it revolves. In our solar system there are eight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
